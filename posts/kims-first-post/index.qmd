This blog is meant to allow us to share what we've been learning through our coding, visualization, and analysis. Currently I am learning about Quarto blogs, so this is a very boring post - I'll be playing with formatting.

# Header 1.1

I assume tables of contents and headers will work the way they usually do with html files?

## Header 2.1

Just some throwaway text.

## Header 2.2

Another one.

# Header 1.2

Some code and structure:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

# this is folded code
print(paste0("The sum of 1 + 1 is: ", 1 + 1))
```
